# Synergos: Assessment: Health Tracker

This is a health metrics tracking application. It allows users to record and visualize health-related data (e.g., pulse, sugar, weight, etc.) over time. Entries are grouped by timestamp, and users can expand/collapse these groups, filter them or edit/delete them individually or by group. A Bar and a Line chart are also provided for better visualization.

# Design Philosophy ðŸŽ¨

Simplicity and Clarity: The interface is kept minimal and intuitive, with clear grouping of metrics by timestamp and visible control buttons for editing or deleting.

Accessibility and UX: Icons, hover states, and collapsible sections provide good user experience across themes (dark/light).

Responsive and Modular: Tailwind CSS allows for scalable styling while maintaining responsiveness across screen sizes. Components are modular and manageable for future extension.

Validation & Feedback: Inputs are validated on submission to ensure data integrity. A snackbar system provides consistent feedback to the user on all actions (e.g., success/failure).

Dark Mode Support: Fully compatible with dark mode using Tailwindâ€™s dark: variants, ensuring accessibility and aesthetic consistency.
